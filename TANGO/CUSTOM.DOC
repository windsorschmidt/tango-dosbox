            Custom Super-VGA drivers:

            The driver SVGA.DRV is used in conjunction with the setup
            utility CUSTOM.EXE to customize a driver for resolutions up
            to 832x624.  CUSTOM.EXE modifies your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to
            add a line of driver parameter information which SVGA.DRV
            uses to set your graphics board into the requested 16-color
            mode.  In order to use CUSTOM.EXE, your board must support
            some Super-VGA mode at or below the above mentioned
            resolution (800x600 is most common).  The video BIOS ROM on
            the board must support such a mode, 16-color drawing in that
            mode must be done using the standard VGA hardware registers,
            and the video memory must be mapped to the standard VGA
            address at segment 0A000H.  All of the above qualifications
            must be confirmed in the hardware documentation which came
            with your board.  If all of the above qualifications are
            met, then you may use CUSTOM.EXE to set up your system to
            run a 16-color 800x600 driver.  You will also have to
            determine the mode number of the super-VGA graphics mode
            which you will wish to enter, and the setting of the CPU
            registers for the mode setting call (video INT 10h).  This
            information should be in your hardware documentation.

            At the DOS prompt, invoke CUSTOM.EXE by typing:

                 C> custom

            followed by a carriage return.

            CUSTOM will initially ask for the X- & Y-resolutions of the
            desired driver.  Assuming we wish to generate an 800x600
            driver, respond with the following:

                 SVGA X-resolution [640]?  800
                 SVGA Y-resolution [480]?  600

            Follow each response with a carriage return.  The currently
            selected default appears in square brackets.  If at any time
            you wish to select the default, respond with a carriage
            return.

            After specifying the screen resolution, CUSTOM now asks
            about aspect ratio correction.  Most color monitors have the
            required 4:3 aspect ratio, so the correction factor 1.00
            should be used.  However it is expressed as a percentage;
            so, 1.00 = 100%.  If your screen needs to be stretched in
            the vertical direction, use a percentage greater than 100;
            for example, the correction factor for EGA resolution
            (640x350) is 1.37, or 137%.  For 800x600, the correction
            factor is 1.00, or 100%.

                 Aspect ratio correction  [100]?

            The above line assumes that the computed default value, 100,
            is the one which is desired.

            CUSTOM will now ask for the CPU register values for the mode
            setting call (video INT 10H).  A 16 bit CPU register value
            has two halves.  The upper or high 8 bits of the AX register
            are in AH and the lower 8 bits are in AL.  When CUSTOM asks
            for the values of the CPU registers required for setting
            your video card, you should supply both halves of the
            register as a single hexadecimal value.  For example, if
            your hardware documentation specifies that AH should be set
            to 6Fh and AL set to 05h for a particular mode setting, then
            the AX register would have a value of 6F05.  A typical
            user's manual for a video card may only give a mode value
            for a particular graphics resolution.  In general, this
            assumes that AL should be set to that mode value and that AH
            should be set to 00h.  For example,  the Orchid Pro-Designer
            board requires a mode value of 29h.  So the correct
            responses for the Orchid board are:

                 Hexadecimal MODE value for AX [0012]?  0029
                 Hexadecimal MODE value for BX [0000]?
                 Hexadecimal MODE value for CX [0000]?
                 Hexadecimal MODE value for DX [0000]?

            Note that BX, CX, and DX are "don't care's" and are
            indicated by responding with a carriage return.

            For the Video 7 VRAM board, the mode setting call requires
            AX=6F05h, and BX=62h; CX and DX are don't care values.  Note
            that BX=62h is the same as BX=0062h which is the same as
            BH=00h and BL=62h.  The correct responses are as follows for
            the Video 7 VRAM board:

                 Hexadecimal MODE value for AX [0012]?  6F05
                 Hexadecimal MODE value for BX [0000]?  0062
                 Hexadecimal MODE value for CX [0000]?
                 Hexadecimal MODE value for DX [0000]?

            After the above dialog, you will be allowed to go back and
            make any corrections:

                 Do you wish to change any of the above [Y]?  N

            Respond "N" when you are satisfied.  Finally you will be
            asked if you wish to change your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  If you
            choose to modify this file, then every time you boot, the
            correct environment setting for TANGODRV=  will be placed in
            the environment.  Otherwise, the file SVGA.BAT will be
            created in directory C:\, and will have to be executed
            whenever you wish to set the TANGODRV=  environment
            variable.

                 Do you wish to update AUTOEXEC.BAT now [N]?


                                     Page 2





            =========================CUSTOM.DOC=========================

            If you choose "N", then the following comment will appear:

                 Updating the file C:\SVGA.BAT

            If you choose "Y", then the following comment will appear:

                 Updating the file C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT

            You must either execute the batch file "SVGA", or re-boot
            your computer to make sure the TANGODRV=  environment
            variable is properly set.  You may confirm its setting with
            the DOS command "SET", used to examine the environment
            variable settings.

            With TANGODRV=  set properly, you may now run the TANGO
            application program, say, PCB or SCH, specifying SVGA as the
            driver:

                 PCB /g:SVGA

                       or; e.g.,

                 SCH /g:C:\TANGO\MYDIR\SVGA

            The first example above assumes that SVGA.DRV exists in the
            directory from which you invoke PCB.  Otherwise you will
            have to precede the driver name with a full pathname, as in
            the second example for SCH.  Note that you need only invoke
            the application in this manner once; it will remember what
            graphics driver to use in the future.

            Lastly, if the CUSTOMized driver does not work, revert to
            the VGA driver with:

                 PCB /g:VGA
