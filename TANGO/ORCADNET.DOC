       OrCAD/SDT users  have been stymied in their use of Tango-PCB and Tango-
       PCB PLUS  since Tango  was updated  to Version  2.   At  that  time  an
       autoplacement feature was added to Tango-PCB PLUS and thus both PCB and
       PCB PLUS  began to  care about  what was  on the  second  line  of  the
       component section of the Tango-format net list.  Heretofore, the second
       line was ignored.  The component section of the net list looks thus:

       [
       refdes
       package
       type
       value (for certain components)
       (blank line)
       (blank line)
       ]

       OrCAD/SDT's net  list generator  has  routinely  placed  the  component
       "type"  on   the  "package"  line  should  no  package  information  be
       available.   The "type"  is then  specified a second time on the "type"
       line.

       For the  sake of  clarity, terminology by ACCEL and OrCAD translates as
       follows:

            Tango/ACCEL              OrCAD
            -----------              -----
            RefDes                   Reference
            Package (aka Pattern)    Module Name
            Type                     Part Name (aka Part Value)


       With the  introduction of  OrCAD/SDT IV, the net list formats have been
       externalized to the program and are interpreted at run time.  Therefore
       it was possible to edit the TANGO.CF net list configuration file to fix
       the aforementioned problem.

       Using the new TANGO.CF file (a note within the file indicates it is now
       called Version 1.1 to distinguish it from the original file), OrCAD/SDT
       4.04 users  can generate  a net  list which will leave the Package line
       blank if  the components  on the schematic were not edited with Package
       information.

       However, users  of Tango-PCB PLUS wishing to take full advantage of its
       autoplacement facility  should read  on.   OrCAD/SDT will permit you to
       edit components  on the  sheet and  place Package  information with the
       component.    By  properly  configuring  the  net  list  generator,  as
       described below,  this Package  information will  then be placed on the
       Package line  of the net list.  Then, after being loaded into Tango-PCB
       PLUS, the components may be autoplaced, saving a lot of time.

       To edit  the components  in OrCAD/SDT Draft, run the Edit Part command,
       select one  of the  available "Part  Fields" 1 through 8, (we recommend



                                       Page 1

       using the  "1st Part  Field"), select "Name" on the next menu, and then
       type in  the name  of the  Package (ie,  DIP16) that you wish to use in
       Tango-PCB PLUS for that component.  All parts of a multi-part component
       should have identical Package names.  (See page 77 of the SDT Reference
       Guide for information on Edit Part, and page 34 for more information on
       "Key fields.")

       Now, prior to executing the net list select "Configure Schematic Design
       Tools."   Page down  several times  until you  find the section "Create
       Netlist."   Under that  section are two parameters:  In the "Part Value
       Combine" field,  key in a "V"  --  In the "Module Value Combine" field,
       key in  the number  of the Part Field you selected to place the Package
       information.   For example,  if using  Edit Part you placed the Package
       name in  the 1st  Part Field, key in "1."  If you selected the 8th Part
       Field, key  in an  "8." (See  page 42  of the  SDT Reference  Guide for
       information on this configuration procedure).

       The net  list generator  will extract  the data  in the  Part Field and
       combine it  on the  "Module Name"  line of  the net list, which is just
       where Tango wants to see it.
