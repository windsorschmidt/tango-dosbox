INTRODUCTION

Tango-PCB  PLUS Version 2.30 contains the enhancements and  bug  fixes,
described below.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

ACCEL  has standardized on an automatic installation program,  INSTALL,
which  uses compressed files on the distribution diskettes.  The Tango-
PCB PLUS Reference Manual contains complete instructions for using this
utility.   The minimum free disk space required for a full installation
of this release is 3.2 MB.


NEW FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS

The  following  features have been added or improved in  this  release.
Please  consult the Release Notes for a detailed description  of  these
enhancements.

OPTIMIZING  NETS  RECONNECT - Before this release, the  Nets  Reconnect
     command  would  create bluelines in a daisy-chain fashion--without
     regard  for  connection  lengths.  Now  Nets  Reconnect  optimizes
     bluelines  as it creates them.  There is no choice of optimization
     methods; Nets Reconnect always optimizes for total (x + y) length.
     
ENHANCED GERBER INPUT FOR PANELIZATION - Tango-PCB PLUS makes it easier
     to  panelize your Gerber output.  Before this release,  loading  a
     photoplot  file  would  clear the current design.   This  made  it
     tedious  to create a layout with many panels, either of  the  same
     layer  or  different ones.  Now loading a photoplot file does  not
     clear the design, and you can choose the destination layer.   Note
     that all holed apertures will produce through-hole pads; non-holed
     apertures  will  produce  surface-pads  on  the  TOP  layer  only,
     regardless of destination.
     
MORE GERBER  APERTURES  -  The  number of  Gerber  apertures  has  been
     increased: the highest-numbered aperture is now 250.
     
     NOTE:  version  2.30  .DFN  files are not  fully  compatible  with
     previous versions.  Versions before 2.30 will not process aperture
     definitions for D-Codes over 99, but they will process assignments-
     -reassign these by hand, or clear them and use the Auto button.
     
OUTPUT  REPORTS FILE VIEWER - Another output option has been  added  to
     the  Output Reports destination group: the “View” option sends the
     output  directly to the Viewer.  From the viewer, the entire  file
     can be inspected, or output to a file or port.
     
DRIVERS  -  Several  graphics drivers and a printer  driver  have  been
     added:
     
          VESA800.DRV     The  VESA800 graphics  driver  supports  VESA
          graphics at 800x600 resolution.
          
          VESA1024.DRV    The  VESA1024 graphics driver  supports  VESA
          graphics at 1024x768 resolution.
          
          VESA1280.DRV    The  VESA1200 graphics driver  supports  VESA
          graphics in 1280x1024 resolution.
          
          VESA8G.DRV      The  VESA8G  graphics  driver  supports  VESA
          graphics in 800x600 resolution, for VESA implementations with
          Red and Green switched (GRB instead of RGB).
          
          VESA10G.DRV     The  VESA10G graphics  driver  supports  VESA
          graphics  in  1024x768  resolution, for VESA  implementations
          with Red and Green switched (GRB instead of RGB).
          
          VESA12G.DRV     The  VESA12G graphics  driver  supports  VESA
          graphics  in  1280x1024 resolution, for VESA  implementations
          with Red and Green switched (GRB instead of RGB).
          
          See VESA.DOC for more information.
          
          BJ180.DRV A Bubble Jet printer driver is now available.  This
          driver  supports A and B sized Black/White output at  180x180
          dpi for Cannon Bubble Jet printers.
          
KNOWN PROBLEMS

1.   DXF OVAL PADS - Oval pads show up as lines in DXF output, when the
     lines/arcs/circles option is selected.
     
2.   NETS  OPTIMIZE - This command currently does not support partially
     routed  nets,  and  may  drop connections from  them  rather  than
     optimizing.   If this happens, use Nets Reconnect to  replace  the
     connections.
     
3.   OUTPUT  DRIVERS  -  Even though the driver input  control  in  the
     second  Output  Plot/Print dialog will accept manual  entry,  this
     entry  is  ignored; drivers can only be selected from the  drivers
     list box.
     
4.   MOVE ENDPOINT - It is sometime possible to fool Move Endpoint  and
     leave  a  dangling blueline.  If a line connected  to  another  is
     deleted and replaced with a blueline, then the line is replaced by
     Place  Line  (not Nets Route), Move Endpoint at that  intersection
     may move the lines but leave the blueline.  This can be fixed with
     Nets  Reconnect,  but it is always best to route connections  with
     Nets Route.
     
5.   SELECT  LINE  - Some diagonal lines cannot be selected  except  at
     their  endpoints;  others can be selected even if  the  cursor  is
     close  to but not over the line.  These problems never occur  with
     lines  at  90-  or 45-degree angles, but only with  non-orthogonal
     lines.
     
6.   SQUARE APERTURES - If you use a Square Aperture draw aperture  you
     may  see some 'chunks' missing from corners of your polygons  when
     you load your photoplot file.
     
7.   BLUE  LINES  -  Deleting Polygons or Arcs, or Lines that  are  not
     routed  to  Pad Centers, will not give 'blue lines'  if  they  are
     deleted.
     
8.   MACROS - Under extreme low-memory conditions, you may receive  two
     out-of-memory  error  messages while  recording  a  macro.   After
     acknowledging the first, the program may appear to be hung but  it
     is  actually  waiting for another acknowledgment: hit  <Enter>  to
     return to normal processing.
     
9.   POLYGONS  -  Complicated polygons are those with many simultaneous
     vertical edges; e.g., a polygon that looks like a horizontal  saw,
     with  all  of  its  points at the same y-coordinate.   Complicated
     polygons  outline  correctly, but do not  fill  correctly  on  the
     display.   Also,  there  may  not  be  enough  memory  to   output
     complicated  polygons,  depending on the  size,  scaling  factors,
     available memory, and driver used (the Postscript drivers are  not
     affected).  If you run out of memory while outputting, you can try
     purging  the Undo information (File DOS will do this),  break  the
     polygon into two or more smaller polygons, or rotate the image  to
     change  the vertical edges into horizontal ones.  Also,  extremely
     narrow polygons may not be displayed at some zoom levels.
     


ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

1.   NETS  RECONNECT  WITH  MULTIPLE  PLANE  NETS  -  When  using  Nets
     Reconnect with a split-plane design, you must make sure that  free
     pads  and vias are disconnected from the power and ground  planes.
     If  they  are connected, Nets Reconnect (and Nets Verify and  DRC)
     will detect a short, and stop without filling primitives with  net
     information.  If you wish to reload the netlist for  a board  with
     free  pad  or via plane-connections, you must follow these  steps:
     1)  disconnect  all free pads and vias from the power  and  ground
     planes,  keeping track of them for future reference; 2)  load  the
     netlist; 3) Nets Reconnect; 4) use Nets Plane Assign for the plane
     nets  (this should replace all of your plane connections); 5)  run
     Nets  Reconnect  again  if superfluous bluelines  remain;  and  6)
     referring to your notes from step 1), reconnect any leftover  pads
     and  vias to the power or ground planes.  Once the primitives have
     net  information, you should never have to disconnect the pad  and
     via plane connections in order to load your netlist.

2.   NETS  ROUTE  SUSPENSION  - You can use "set TANGOSLASH=string"  in
     your  AUTOEXEC.BAT file to assign alternate keys  for  suspension;
     there  are  several  things to keep in mind.  You  must  use  only
     printable characters in your string.  These characters can have no
     other  meanings: hotspot and macro keys will not work.  Using  the
     TANGOSLASH  variable  at all replaces the  slash  keys  with  your
     string; the slash keys will no longer work unless included in your
     string.

3.   POSTSCRIPT  CARTRIDGES  - Some PostScript  cartridges  cause  port
     timeout errors; this usually happens because they are not finished
     processing the current page when sent more data, and they have not
     set  the  port busy-flag. Some cartridges redefine the  page  size
     regardless of instructions received to the contrary; these devices
     print out an A4-size output on two A4-size sheets instead of  one.
     Neither of these problems occur on any true PostScript printer  we
     have tested or on other cartridges.

4.   KEYWORDS  - The .DATE, .TIME, or .FILENAME keywords are  refreshed
     whenever  output--whether  the  output  is  to  the  screen  or  a
     peripheral device.  Only the keyword strings are stored, not their
     resultant  text.  This means that selecting them for movement  may
     create "text placed on text" for the keyword.  This does not occur
     for  .FILENAME.  It can occur for .DATE if placed today and  moved
     tomorrow,  and occurs often for .TIME.  Zoom Redraw  corrects  the
     display.  When printing, if the .TIME keyword crosses two or  more
     printing passes, its output may change between them.

5.   ROUTING WITH MULTIPLE PLANE NETS - Tango-Route PLUS fully supports
     designs with one power and one ground net, but has limited support
     for  the  Multiple  Plane Nets feature in  this  version:   unless
     surface-mount pads are fanned out to vias in Tango-PCB PLUS, Tango
     Route  PLUS will not route them or otherwise connect them  to  the
     plane;  if fanned out to vias, the vias will be connected  to  the
     plane.  Tango RoutePRO supports a maximum of one power net and one
     ground net.

6.   DESIGN-BASED  .INI  FILES  -  If the program  is  started  without
     specifying  a design file, the PCB.INI file is always  loaded  and
     processed  first, before the design-based .INI file referenced  in
     PCB.INI.    The   colors  and  settings  (including  speed-palette
     display) stored in PCB.INI will appear momentarily, to be replaced
     immediately  by  the design-based .INI colors and settings.   This
     will  occur when you start the program without specifying a design
     file.

7.   DESIGN-BASED INI FILES - Remember that design-based INI files  are
     only  saved  if the design file is explicitly saved.   This  means
     that  Setup  DRC and Output Reports information and  changes,  for
     instance, will be lost unless you save the design file.  The  rule
     of  thumb  is  now more valid than ever:  when you  want  to  keep
     something, save!  PCB.INI always contains the current setting when
     you exit the program.

8.   DESIGN-BASED  DFN FILES - When Tango-PCB PLUS finds  and  loads  a
     design-based  DFN file, it first clears all definitions.   If  you
     have line, pad, via, text, custom speed-palette or CAM definitions
     or  assignments  that you want to keep, make sure they  are  saved
     into  a  design-based DFN file (you will be prompted to do  this),
     because  they  may be overwritten when you load  your  next  file.
     Clearing the DFNs keeps your environment free from the clutter  of
     unused DFNs.  For instance, before this release it was quite  easy
     to  accumulate hundreds of unused pad definitions, which you would
     have to prune by hand (using the Current Pad command) just to keep
     them   manageable.   If  you  wish  to  load  additional   non-CAM
     definitions, use the File Load command to load the desired file as
     a  block, then delete the block:  new DFNs are always created  for
     new  items  placed in the workspace.  PCB.DFN always contains  the
     current DFNs when you exit the program.

9.   OUTPUT  TYPE  SETTINGS  - Remember that each  output  type  (Plot,
     Print,  PostScript, and DXF) has its own complete  set  of  output
     parameters including scaling values and the destination  port  (or
     file).   When  you  change types (using the  driver  List  button,
     driver names can be typed into the input control but they will not
     register  unless selected using List), the program  remembers  the
     parameters for the old type, and replaces them with the remembered
     parameters for the new type--the changes have not been lost.

10.  DXF-IN  DIMENSIONS - When working with dimensions in  AutoCAD,  be
     sure to use the PURGE command before output to DXF.  Each time you
     move  or  otherwise change a dimension, AutoCAD generates  another
     image  for the dimension; these leftover images are output to  DXF
     unless you the PURGE command beforehand.

11.  DXF-IN VALUES - Remember that DXF items that exceed Tango-PCB PLUS
     specifications  cannot be loaded into the workspace.   Items  that
     fall  outside  the workspace boundary, are too big, or  too  thick
     will be discarded after an appropriate error message.  If you need
     such  items to be loaded, you must alter them in your CAD  program
     before  loading the DXF file.  Remember too that many CAD programs
     use external utilities for DXF Export and Import:  changes made in
     the program itself may not be reflected in the DXF file unless you
     run the utility.

12.  GERBER  FILE LOAD - Remember that in order to load and  display  a
     photoplot file correctly, your current aperture descriptions  must
     match  those  used  to  create the file.  If  you  have  loaded  a
     different design file, the current aperture data will be  replaced
     if  there is a DFN file corresponding to that design file.  If you
     are  unsure about your aperture descriptions, the safest procedure
     is  to  reload the design file to get its DFN file, then load  the
     photoplot file; do a File Clear before loading the photoplot  file
     if  you  don't want the clutter--DFNs are cleared only by  loading
     another DFN file.

13.  AUTOSAVE - If an AutoSave hits during a Zoom command, the save  is
     canceled.

14.  BLUE  LINES/DELETE  VIA  -  Deleting  a  Via  that  contains   Net
     information  will not generate a connection line  (or  consolidate
     connection  lines).  If you are deleting 2 line segments  and  the
     Via  that connects them, be sure to delete the Via before deleting
     both  line  segments.  If you delete the Via after  deleting  both
     line segments, the connection lines will not be consolidated,  and
     Nets  Route will force you to route to the location of the deleted
     Via.   If  you use Delete Highlight or Delete Block to remove  the
     Lines and Via you will not see this problem.

15.  .DRV  FILES  -  Do not place any non-supplied .DRV  files  in  the
     directory with your Tango .DRV files.  Tango software looks at the
     .DRV files to present the list of output drivers to the user.   If
     non-supplied files exist in the directory, unexpected behavior may
     result.

16.  LISTING  FILES - Due to the changes we made in filename  filtering
     in  the  File Load list box, you can no longer use X*.PCB to  list
     all  of  your  .PCB  files that start with X.   You  can  use  the
     technique to filter files in the second list box.

17.  BINARY  FILES COMPATIBILITY - The current versions of Tango  Route
     PRO  will  not support binary files.  You must save off  the  file
     using ASCII format before routing.

18.  METRIC GRIDS - Because the resolution of our database is 1 mil, we
     can  only   display or save items in 1 mil increments (not  .1mm).
     The metric grid coordinates that display on the Status Line should
     be thought of as an on-screen calculator that converts an imperial
     location to a metric location.  The visible grid only displays  in
     imperial units.

19.  MACROS  -  Because some commands have been changed, and  some  new
     commands have been added, you may find that some Macros that  were
     recorded  in versions prior to 2.30 may no longer work  correctly.
     You  will  have to re-record any macros that no longer work  using
     version 2.30.

20.  MACROS  -  If  a  macro  contains two  or  more  separate  editing
     commands,  UNDO will only affect the last one; it will not  affect
     the entire macro.

21.  VERSION  1.16 TO 2.30 CONSIDERATIONS - 2.30 requires more  netlist
     information than is contained in version 1.XX files;  be  sure  to
     reload your netlist file to insure proper processing.

22.  PIN  DESIGNATOR MISMATCH - If the pin designators of  a  component
     you  are  auto-placing are different from those  of  the  netlist,
     those  connections  cannot be made.  Also,  if  you  have  already
     placed  a component whose pin designators disagree with a  netlist
     that  you  load,  connections cannot be made, and  no  warning  is
     given.   Run  the  Unplaced  Nodes  DRC  Report  to  detect  these
     potential problems.

23.  OBSOLETE OVERLAY FILES - Overlay files (.OV1 and .OV2) are no
longer used. Delete PCB.OV1 and PCB.OV2 (left over from 1.16) from your
PCB directory.
