Notes for the VESA drivers:
Many graphics card can be made VESA-compatible by running a TSR. Check
your graphics card documentation for Vesa compatibility information
specific to your card.


        VESA800.DRV      800x600x16 colors
        VESA1024.DRV    1024x768x16 colors
        VESA1280.DRV   1280x1024x16 colors

Some cards use a GRB palette (instead of RGB) for the 1024 and 1280
modes.  If this is the case, the red and green colors will be
reversed.  If it is necessary, use the following drivers to map the
colors appropriately:

        VESA8G.DRV       800x600x16 colors (GRB palette)
        VESA10G.DRV     1024x768x16 colors (GRB palette)
        VESA12G.DRV    1280x1024x16 colors (GRB palette)

Known cards and appropriate driver sets include:
